    // I added some of their properties(List of ingredients...)
    // I wrote my PREPARE functions
    
    // Then I did the same for my Indredient class (abstract) and the ingredients themselves (child)
    

    // I created 3 different manager classes (machine, money, product)

    // In the GUI, I created events for the button clicks
    // One for the beverage buttons and one for the coin buttons
